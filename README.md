# sketchbook

As the name says: this is a sketchbook for [p5js](http://p5js.org/) and [Processing](http://processing.org/) and other HTML/CSS/JS-based sketches.

## newSketch

This is a simple script, that generates a new sketch, opens an editor and starts a development server in the directory of the sketch. To make it work, you need to have set a variable "myEditor" in your current shell with the name of your preferred editor as its content.
So one line of your bashrc might look like this:

``` bash
export myEditor="vim"
```

A quick look at it will tell you that it expects the Python interpreter to be at /usr/bin/python, like it is on most Linux versions (and maybe also on Mac OS, I guess).

The script will ask you, what type of sketch you want to start and you have to answer with one of the given options.

## Some sketches

### Complexity

While I started reading "Complexity. A Guided Tour" by Melanie Mitchell (2009), I though it might be nice to code some of the examples. I imagine, some might be web based visualizations, some not.

They are [here](/complexity).
